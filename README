Makerpm builds RPM files from perl modules.  See the documentation in POD
format in the program for details.

The 0.210 release is a bug fix update which should mean makerpm works on
RedHat 7.1.  Test reports are particularly appreciated.  Even more
appreciated would be a test suite. 

N.B. a number of code paths have NOT been tested.  It generates RPMs from my
modules, but little else is guaranteed until other people have tested it.
