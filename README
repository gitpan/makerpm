Makerpm builds RPM files from perl modules.  See the documentation in POD
format in the program for details.

Compared to the inbuilt tools of redhat's system it is more complex
but should generate better RPMS.

The 0.300 release is a bug fix update which fixes handling of
documentation files.  

N.B. in this version makerpm is no longer used in the build process.
This simplifies the build process somewhat.

N.B. a number of code paths have NOT been tested.  It generates RPMs from my
modules, but little else is guaranteed until other people have tested it.
